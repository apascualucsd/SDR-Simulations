# SDR-Simulations
SDR Simulations for different modulation schemes 

Lab 1: Introduction to RF Digital Communication Signals and Systems

Part 1:
Introduce two common radio-frequency communication signal formats—binary-phase-shift
keying (BPSK) and quadrature-phase-shift keying (QPSK). Understand the relationship between
the power density spectrum of the transmitted signal and the signal phase. Understand the
relationship between signal phase, the distance between the transmitter (Tx) and the receiver
(Rx). These signaling formats are generated using gnuradio in the Pluto SDRs using software
that we will be using throughout the class.

Part 2:
Survey several “live” communication signals. For this part, you may be able to modify the Pluto
SDR to observe a wider range of signals

Lab 2: Sampling, Filtering, and Data/Noise Generation 

Quantifying the effect of sampling, pulse shaping, and filtering of random signals such as noise
and binary random signals. Study pseudo-random signals, through simulation.

Lab 3: Bit Error Rate Parameter Estimation for a Basic Modem 

Operation of a matched filter with clock synchronization. Carrier phase estimation of passband
signals using feedback demodulation based on phase-locked loops.

Lab 4: Signal Impairments and Channel Estimation

Characterizing the impairments of phase noise and fading, and how to estimate the channel
response that includes both impairments using a PN sequence.
